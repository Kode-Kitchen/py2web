Py2Web is an utility for people who create webpages. It allows embedding chess problems viewer into the webpages in a way similar to that in which the PGN viewers work. The difference is that Py2Web supports many features that PGN viewers don't, e.g.: idling (set-play, threat, series-movers), twins, fairy pieces, fairy effects (rebirth, piece color change etc).
